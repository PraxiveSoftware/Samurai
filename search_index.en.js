It should look something like this:\n\nUp the top of the config file, we have general information about the browser you are building. This includes its name, the vendor creating it, its appId, and the name of the binary that will be output.\nThe version key is used to specify information about the product you are building. product is the Firefox branch you are building against. version is the version of Firefox you are building against, which will vary with the branch. Here firefox refers to the stable branch of Firefox.\nbuildOptions provides a number of internal toggles for how Samurai builds your project.\nConfigs\nThe configs folder stores a combination of config files that are required by Firefox and assets required by Samurai. By default there are only mozconfig files, Samurai should generate most parts of this config for you. The only part that you will need to change is the source control repo:\n\nThis directory is also where you would put branding assets for your browser\nsrc/\nThe source folder contains all of the modifications that you have made to Firefox. These come in two types, inserted files (and folders) and patches. Both of these are applied using the samurai import command.\nInserted files are just files (and folders) that you have inserted into the Firefox source code. These will overwrite existing files if they already exist. On Linux and MacOS, these are symlinked so when you change a file in src/, the change will be mirrored in Firefox's source code instantly. On Windows, you will need to run samurai import for these changes to apply.\nPatches are changes to Firefox's files. As a rule of thumb, you should prefer splitting new content into a new file rather than using patches, but there are times when you must modify Firefox's source code. Each of these patch files are just git patch files:\n\nIn this patch, you can see that I am adding a * to the start of a line. You generate these patches by modifying the file in the .engine/ directory and running samurai export to export your changes to the src directory. Be careful, if you do not export your changes, they will not be saved and will not work on other developers' computers or yours after an update!\n\n.engine/\nThe .engine directory contains all of Firefox's source code. It is massive - around 15GB in size (around 11GB of that are build assets from when you run samurai build). I am not able to provide a full explanation of the contents of the directory.\nHowever, most of the changes you will want to make will be in .engine/browser/, which contains the source code for the browser's UI. Here are some of the important directories inside of the .engine/browser/ directory:\n\n.engine/browser/base/content: These contain the xhtml files that make up a majority of the browser's ui\n.engine/browser/components: This contains some self-contained UI features, like screenshots, uitours, downloads, etc.\n.engine/browser/themes: Here lies most of the browsers CSS. See Customizing Your Browser's UI for more information.\n\nOne of the best ways to find what you are looking for and get to know the code base is by searching it. However, if you try and search through it on your computer you are in for a world of pain. Instead, I recommend you use SearchFox, which is significantly faster.\n","id":"https://praxivesoftware.github.io/Samurai/getting-started/filestructure/","title":"Understanding the file structure"},"https://praxivesoftware.github.io/Samurai/getting-started/overview/":{"body":"Getting started with samurai\nWhat is samurai\nSamurai is a build tool and documentation for creating firefox-based browsers. Its goal is to simplify the process of creating web browsers to encourage competition and development within the space.\nGetting help\nIf you are having problems with following these instructions, or with samurai in general, please contact us. You can create a discussion on github, ping @jonasfranke (BinaryBlazer - Jonas F. Franke) on the Praxive Community Discord.\nSystem requirements\n\nOS: Linux, MacOS and Windows (Support for Windows is experimental)\nDisk space: 100GB\nRAM: 16GB (8GB minimum, not recommended)\nCPU: 4 cores\nDependencies: NodeJS, Python3, pip3, git\nOptional dependencies: MozillaBuild (Windows only) (download: here)\n\nGetting started\nThe first thing you are going to need to do is to install Samurai. As it is a nodejs program it can be installed through npm or yarn.\n\nNow we suggest you to check if you have all the dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following command:\n\nNext create a git repo and clone it to your local machine. Then run the following:\n\nThis will ask you a variety of questions in relation to your project setup. Firstly, the release of the browser you want to bind to.\n\nThen next is the version of the browser you want to use. By default samurai will populate this with the latest version available, which we recommend using. Simply click enter to accept.\n\nNext it will ask for the name of your browser. Avoid references to Firefox or other Mozilla brands, as this is likely to lead to trademark and copyright issues down the road.\n\nThe binary name is the name that your program will be run from. We recommend that you add -browser to the end to avoid conflicts with common utilities.\n\nVendor is the company (or solo developer) who is creating the browser.\n\nThe appid follows reverse dns naming conventions. For example, Fushra owns the domain fushra.com, so our browser is com.fushra.browser.desktop. If you do not have a domain, you can use your username / pseudonym as the appid, e.g. trickypr.watermelon.\n\nNext you need to chose a starting template for your browser. If you know what you are doing, you can go with None and configure it how you like. Otherwise, we recommend you stick with UserChrome.\n\nNow you have created the directory structure for your project, you can build it for the first time. First, ask samurai to download the firefox source.\n\nIf you are running this for the first time, you will need to install the firefox dependencies. You can do this via boostrapping:\n\nIf you encour any errors with not found pip or MozillaBuild (MozillaBuild: Windows Only) while running the bootstrap command, you can try running the following command:\n\nAfter the source code has been downloaded, the changes to firefox described in the source code must be applied.\n\nAfter running the importation, we have to add files and create our first commit.\n\nFinally, you can start building the firefox source code. This takes around an hour and a half on my computer, but the binary output will be cached, making later builds faster\n\nNow you can finally start the browser!\n\nCommon errors\nHere are some common errors that you might run into whilst running samurai build and some potential fixes.\nAnything to do with wasm-ld\nOn Arch linux, there were two errors that were thrown:\n\nOn Linux, I fixed the first error by installing ldd:\n\nThe second error was fixed by installing the associated wasm libraries:\n\nYou will need to port the above command to your distrobution. If you do not care about the improved security of sandboxed libraries, you can simply disable them by adding the following to ``\n","id":"https://praxivesoftware.github.io/Samurai/getting-started/overview/","title":"Setting up your project"},"https://praxivesoftware.github.io/Samurai/getting-started/userchrome/":{"body":"Customizing Your Browser's UI\nIf you have already setup your project, you should have a working version of firefox that you built yourself:\n\nJust like Electron apps, the entire Firefox ui is an (x)html page that is styled with css. This makes the process of giving our browser an identity very easy.\nBecause it is just web technologies, we can use debugging tools (like inspect element) to understand what changes we want to make to the browser. You can open these debugging tools by pressing the keyboard shortcut CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + I (CMD + OPTION + SHIFT + I on MacOS).\n\nBecause this is a more visual process, the rest of this tutorial is going to be in this video:\n\nThis is the end of the guided section of the documentation.

For example, Praxive has the following information attached to its alpha brand.\n\nThe release key includes both the latest version (displayVersion) and release info. In this case, binaries are released to github. For x86, we provide a number of .mar files for each platform. .mar files are \"Mozilla Archives\" and are used to distribute updates.\nWhen creating update manifests, they will point to the release tagged displayVersion. The update manifests tell Mozilla's updater to download the update manifest with the version that corresponds with the file name above. So an x86 linux computer will download the linux.mar file and use that to update.\nCreating MAR files and update manifests\nBoth .mar files and the update manifests are automatically created by running samurai package. This will generate a number of files in the dist directory.\nAn output.mar will be included in the root, which you should rename to the appropriate platform. For example, linux.mar for linux. This should be included with your GitHub release.\nUpdate manifests are stored in the dist/update directory. The contents of this directory should be uploaded to a webserver (e.g. GitHub Pages or S3) such that their root is at /updates/browser/.\nYou will then need to set the updateHostname in samurai.json to the url of your update server.

For example:\n\nMore information regarding the available keys for this config object can be found in the reference section.\nYou will then need to create the folder config/branding/&lt;brand_name&gt;.
